# Tech Support Manager - Mobile Devices Optative TEC Course Project (Proposed App to Teacher). 

## Project Description:

Students at the TEC [Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica] have the possibility to work as technical support assistants to the functionaries in this university. This app is intended to help students to report their progress on technical support tasks and attach their progress.
Another module for functionaries was developed as well, which is intended to send tasks to other students, and monitor their progress on the assigned tasks. 

As a suggestion of the teacher in the course, an additional feature was added, which helps students and teachers, to register and search assets in this university.
